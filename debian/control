Description: This program is a cross-platform, open-source World of Warcraft model viewer, 
 created to showcase the capabilities of libwarcraft.
 .
 Everlook will be capable of browsing, exporting and converting most World of Warcraft
 formats up until Wrath of the Lich King, and is under active development. The current 
 goal is to act as an open, simple and feature-complete replacement for 
 World of Warcraft Model Viewer.
 .
 Currently, Everlook is in early development and may not be usable in your day-to-day 
 activities.
 .
 Features:
  - Explore multiple game versions in one application
  - Explore games on an archive-by-archive basis, or as a unified virtual file tree
  - Export files from the archives
  - View textures stored in most major image formats, as well as BLP
  - View WMO models
 .
 Known issues:
  - No format-specific export functions have been implemented.
  - The export queue does not work beyond the UI.
  - Everlook lacks any testing on Windows-based systems.
  - The UI becomes sluggish when loading directories with many files in them 
    (mainly Textures/Minimap and Textures/BakedNPCTextures, who both have 
    thousands of files under a single directory).
  - Standard models are not rendered in the viewport.
 .
 If you want to help out, I'll gladly accept pull requests and patches for the 
 code.
